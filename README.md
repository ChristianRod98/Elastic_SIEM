# Elastic_SIEM
In this lab, I successfully build and configure elastic stack SIEM in a home lab environment and demonstrate experience deploying a kali linux virtual machine, as well as generating and analyzing security events using Nmap. With these tools I was able to develope a custom dashboard in elastic SIEM to visualize security events, demonstrate skills in data interpretation and pattern recognition. Lastly, in theis lab I successfully created and tested alert rules for detecting specific security events to show competency in proactive incident response and alert managment.
